# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description


- This is a webpage to hold my pre-work notes.
- I built it to keep track of notes, and build a very basic understanding of programs we will be using in the course.
- The webpage allows for one location to look to for pre-work notes.
- Over the course of creating this page I learned a very basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
